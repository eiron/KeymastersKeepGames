So far, this includes Archipelagourmet, a meta-game in which the options generarated will be recipes, and/or takeaway and restaurant options provided by the player.
Some default options are provided for clarity, but can easily be overwritten with whatever the player desires.

This also features a submodule that include challenges of the type:

``"Make a meal using each of the following ingredients: {3-5 random ingredients}"``

This includes options for filtering by dietary requirements, as well as blocking unwanted ingredients and adding custom ingredients.
You can also set the range for the number of random ingredients from 1 through 10, though there is a chance too high a number will cause the challenge to be unreadable in the client!
