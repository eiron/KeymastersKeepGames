Keymaster's Keep games maintained by eiron

So far, this includes a first build of Archipelagourmet, a meta-game in which the options generarated will be recipes, and/or takeaway and restaurant options provided by the player.
Some default options are provided for clarity, but can easily be overwritten with whatever the player desires.

An additional submodule is being worked on to also include challenges of the type:

``"Make a meal using each of the following ingredients: {2-3 random ingredients}"``

This will include options for filtering by dietary requirements, as well as blocking unwanted ingredients and adding custom ingredients.
