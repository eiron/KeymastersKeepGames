- **üéÆ Interactive Testing**: Menu-driven interface for testing individual games or running full test suites

### Usage

```bash
# Test all discovered game implementations
cd UniversalGameTester
python universal_game_tester.py

# Test a specific game implementation
python universal_game_tester.py stardew_valley_game.py

- **Dynamic Mocking**: Creates universal mock environment for all possible imports
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles import failures, missing attributes, and malformed data

## Include Option Standards

All game implementations follow a standardized approach for include Toggle options:

- **Basic Content**: All fundamental include options default to `True` for better objective generation
- **Specialized/Harder Content**: Options for speedruns, difficulty challenges, or specialized content default to `False` 
- **Cursed/Tedious Modules**: Games like "Cursed Red Dead Redemption 2" and "Really Boring Challenges" have all options default to `True`, as players are deliberately opting into that content type

This ensures that casual players get comprehensive objective generation by default, while preserving the option to disable challenging or specialized content categories.
